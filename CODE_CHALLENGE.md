# Code Challenge

Your goal is to create a sample app that displays information about various contacts. You may use any online resource or documentation to complete the assignment, as long as you write the code yourself. Using open source or 3rd-party libraries is allowed.
					
The app should have at least two screens:
					
1) __Contact List__
* This screen should display a list of contacts retrieved from this JSON endpoint: https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/rgasp-mobile-test/v1/content.json
* Each item should have the contact picture and name
			
2) __Details__
* Tapping on a contact in the first screen should display a second screen containing the details of that contact.
* Display the contact name, email and other available info on this screen

Your app should also contain a CRUD of contacts:
* After loading info from webservices, user should be able to add, remove and edit any user. This should be saved locally and you don't need to connect the webservice again.
					
What will be evaluated		
As long as the above criteria are fulfilled, UI/UX design is at your discretion. That being said, part of what we'll be evaluating is the level of polishness in both the code itself and the user interface you create.
					
We will care about how your code and interface is organized, the libraries you used, how you accessed local DB and webservices. Animations and transitions are also important.
					
__BONUS POINTS__
* Material Design (for Android candidates) and Automated tests
					
What to deliver				
* You should pull request your code into this repository.
* Write a clean README containing:
* justification of chosen libraries
* short description about how to generate your app
* general explanation about your code and app
* what should you change on your implementation if you have more time
					
Good luck!
